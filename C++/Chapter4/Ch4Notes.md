**4.1 Modulus Operator**
The modulus operator works on integers and yields the remainder when the first operand is divided by the second.
Ex.     int quotient = 7 / 3;
        int remainder = 7 % 3;
        
**4.2 Conditional Execution**
The expression in parenthesis (x > 0) is called the condition.
Ex. Comparison Operators:
              x == y    // x equals y
              x != y    // x is not equal to y
              x > y     // x is greater than y
              x < y     // x is less than y
              x >= y    // x is greater than or equal to y
              x <= y    // x is less than or equal to y

**4.3 Alternative Execution**
Alternative Execution is when there are two possibilities, and the condition determines which one gets executed.
Ex.         if (x % 2 == 0) {
                cout << "x is even" << endl;
            } else {
                cout << "x is odd" << endl;
            }
